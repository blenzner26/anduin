# Tolkien Manuscript Project
This project contains two parts and were both developed at the same time. The first (main) part of the project is an application developed for Tolkien researchers and enthusiasts to explore the manuscripts of _The Lord of the Rings_. The second part was developed for an exhibit.

**Note:** manuscript images have been removed from both parts due to copyright.

## Anduin
The first is a web application that contains digital scans of all of the manuscripts from _The Lord of the Rings_ in a chronological order of when J.R.R. Tolkien first drafted each draft.

## Exhibit
The second part of this project is an interactive application developed for a related museum exhibition that took place while Anduin was under development. This was created using React.js.
