# Anduin
Anduin™ is an application used to study Tolkien’s manuscripts for The Lord of the Rings at Marquette University. It contains digital scans of all the manuscripts and enables researchers to navigate easily through Marquette's collection, studying Tolkien's magnum opus by book, chapter, draft of chapter, and (eventually) by individual passage.
